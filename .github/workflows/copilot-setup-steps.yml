      # As an alternative, we setup a nix cache and install the tools which is reasonably
      # fast on GitHub hosted runners (but dog slow on self-hosted runners).

      # Since we instruct copilot to always do builds before commiting, we add a warmup step here to ensure
      # that a lot of gradle work has been done before copilot starts its work. Since copilot starts from a develop
      # branch, most of the time we should also be able to fetch a lot from the gradle cache.
